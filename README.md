# Easysnippet
### a plugin for inserting Snippets into a Wolf CMS page

> TODO: screenshots/feature-list

## Easily insert any Snippet's code anywhere in your Page

Displays the full list of all your Snippets in **a menu**, so that you can use them  
quickly while editing a Page. An option to **display buttons** instead (for when you  
don't have that many snippets) can be enabled in the Settings panel.

When a menu option is selected or a button is clicked, the corresponding Snippet  
**code is inserted** into your Page at the cursor.


## Download

## Installation

Remove *-master* from the folder name, if you used GitHub's button to download a ZIP.  
Put the resulting folder in your `wolf/plugins/` folder, so that the file `index.php`  
is in `wolf/plugins/easysnippet/index.php` and enable the plugin in Administration tab.
