## Easily insert any Snippet's code anywhere in your Page

Easysnippet displays the full list of all your Snippets in **a menu**, so that you can  
use them quickly while editing a Page. An option to **display buttons** instead  
(for when you don't have that many snippets) can be enabled in the Settings panel.

When a menu option is selected or a button is clicked, the corresponding Snippet  
**code is inserted** into your Page at the cursor.


## Download

> TODO: link to two tagged releases, for 0.7.x and 0.8.x

## Installation

Just remove *-master* from the folder name, if you used GitHub's button to download a ZIP.  
Put the resulting folder in your `wolf/plugins/` folder, so that the file `index.php`  
is in `wolf/plugins/easysnippet/index.php` and enable the plugin in Administration tab.
